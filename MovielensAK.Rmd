## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
Executive summary
This project is for educational purposes as a submission for the course HarvardX: PH125.9x Data Science Capstone. The objective of the project is to train a machine learning algorithm that could predict movie ratings.

#Dataset
#Movielens dataset
dl <- tempfile()
download.file("http://files.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ml-10m.zip", dl)
ratings <- read.table(text = gsub("::", "\t", readLines(unzip(dl, "ml-10M100K/ratings.dat"))),
                      col.names = c("userId", "movieId", "rating", "timestamp"))
movies <- str_split_fixed(readLines(unzip(dl, "ml-10M100K/movies.dat")), "\\::", 3)
colnames(movies) <- c("movieId", "title", "genres")
movies <- as.data.frame(movies) %>% mutate(movieId = as.numeric(levels(movieId))[movieId],
                                           title = as.character(title),
                                           genres = as.character(genres))
movielens <- left_join(ratings, movies, by = "movieId")
```
This loads the movielens dataset
```{r}
# Validation set will be 10% of MovieLens data
set.seed(1)
test_index <- createDataPartition(y = movielens$rating, times = 1, p = 0.1, list = FALSE)
edx <- movielens[-test_index,]
temp <- movielens[test_index,]
# Make sure userId and movieId in validation set are also in edx set
validation <- temp %>% 
  semi_join(edx, by = "movieId") %>%
  semi_join(edx, by = "userId")
# Add rows removed from validation set back into edx set
removed <- anti_join(temp, validation)
edx <- rbind(edx, removed)
rm(dl, ratings, movies, test_index, temp, movielens, removed)
```
Now we perform summary statistics on the dataset of Edx
```{r}
#first 6 rows with head function
head(edx)
```
This shows that Edx contains "userId", "movieId", "rating", "timestamp","title","genres" in the data
```{r}
#summary statistics
summary(edx)
n_distinct(edx$movieId)
n_distinct(edx$rating)
n_distinct(edx$userId)
n_distinct(edx$genres)
med_rating <- median(edx$rating)
med_rating
```
This shows that there are 10677 unique movies, 69878 unique users, and 797 unique genres.
```{r}
#Data visualization
edx %>%
  ggplot(aes(rating)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.5, color = "blue") +
  xlab("Rating") +
  ylab("Number of") +
  ggtitle("Ratings Histogram") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```
This plot shows that majority of movie ratings are 4, 3, 5 respectively.
```{r}
#Top 10 popular genres
pop_genres <- edx %>%
  group_by(genres) %>%
  summarise(number = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(number))
knitr::kable(head(pop_genres,10))
```
This shows that the most popular genre is Drama followed by Comedy
```{r}
#Ratings vs Users
edx %>%
  count(userId) %>%
  ggplot(aes(n)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "blue", bin = 30) +
  scale_x_log10() +
  xlab("Number of Ratings") +
  ylab("Number of Users") +
  ggtitle("Users vs Ratings") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```
We can see from this plot that the users rate between 10 to 100 movies.
```{r}
#Data analysis
mu <- mean(edx$rating)
mu
```
```{r}
#basic mean analysis
rmse_basic <- RMSE(validation$rating, mu)
rmse_basic
```
This prediction model uses the mean of the dataset to predict the rating for movies. The model assumes that all differences are due to random error.
We see that RMSE from basic mean model is 1.060651
```{r}
#creating a table to display all the results of analysis
rmse_table = tibble(Analysis = "Basic Analysis", RMSE = rmse_basic)
rmse_table %>% knitr::kable()
```
Here we add the RMSE from basic mean model to a table for better display.
```{r}
#Introducing movie effect
movie_effect <- edx %>%
  group_by(movieId) %>%
  summarise(a = mean(rating - mu))
predict_ratings <- mu + validation %>%
  left_join(movie_effect, by = "movieId") %>%
  pull(a)
rmse_movie_effect <- RMSE(predict_ratings, validation$rating)
rmse_movie_effect
```
This time we introduce a bias to the model, this model calculates a bias term for each movie based on the difference between the movies mean rating and the overall mean rating.
The RMSE of Movie Effect Model is 0.9437046
```{r}
#Adding Movie effect result to the table
rmse_table <- bind_rows(rmse_table, tibble(Analysis = "Movie Effect Analysis", RMSE = rmse_movie_effect))
rmse_table %>% knitr::kable()
```
We now add the results of the RMSE from Movie effect model to the table we have created previously.
```{r}
#Introducing user effect
user_effect <- edx %>%
  group_by(userId) %>%
  summarise(b = mean(rating - mu))
predict_ratings <- validation %>%
  left_join(user_effect, by = "userId") %>%
  pull(b)
rmse_user_effect <- RMSE(predict_ratings, validation$rating)
rmse_user_effect
```
This model calculates a biad term for each user based on the difference between the users maen rating and the overall mean rating.
The RMSE of User Effect Model is 3.64577
```{r}
#Adding the User effect result to the table
rmse_table <- bind_rows(rmse_table, tibble(Analysis = "User Effect Analysis", RMSE = rmse_user_effect))
rmse_table %>% knitr::kable()
```
We added the User Effect Model to the table
```{r}
#Introducing genre effect
genre_effect <- edx %>%
  group_by(genres) %>%
  summarise(c = mean(rating - mu))
predict_ratings <- validation %>%
  left_join(genre_effect, by = "genres") %>%
  pull(c)
rmse_genre_effect <- RMSE(predict_ratings, validation$rating)
rmse_genre_effect
```
This model calculates a bias term for each genre based on the difference between the genres mean rating and the overall mean rating
The RMSE of Genre Effect Model is 3.656522.
```{r}
#Adding Genre effect result to the table
rmse_table <- bind_rows(rmse_table, tibble(Analysis = "Genre Effect Analysis", RMSE = rmse_genre_effect))
rmse_table %>% knitr::kable()
```
In the following model we incorporate user effects to the model.
```{r}
#Introducing both movie and user effects
user_effect <- edx %>%
  left_join(movie_effect, by = "movieId") %>%
  group_by(userId) %>%
  summarise(a_u = mean(rating - mu - a))
predict_ratings <- validation %>%
  left_join(movie_effect, by = "movieId") %>%
  left_join(user_effect, by = "userId") %>%
  mutate(d = mu + a + a_u) %>%
  pull(d)
rmse_movie_user_effect <- RMSE(predict_ratings, validation$rating)
rmse_movie_user_effect
```
The RMSE is 0.8655329
We observe that the RMSE has significantly reduced from the previous models.
```{r}
#Addind Movie-User Effect result to the table
rmse_table <- bind_rows(rmse_table, tibble(Analysis = "Movied & User Effect Analysis", RMSE = rmse_movie_user_effect))
rmse_table %>% knitr::kable()
```
Regularization allows for reduced error in the model caused by the movies with fewer ratings compared to the other movies in the dataset.
```{r}
#regularization
lambdas <- 10
rmses <- sapply(lambdas, function(lambdas) {
  mu <- mean(edx$rating)
  x <- edx %>%
    group_by(movieId) %>%
    summarise(x = sum(rating - mu) / (n()+1))
  y <- edx %>%
    left_join(x, by = "movieId") %>%
    group_by(userId) %>%
    summarise(y = sum(rating - x - mu) / (n()+1))
  
  predicted_ratings <- validation %>%
    left_join(x, by = "movieId") %>%
    left_join(y, by = "userId") %>%
    mutate(z = mu + x + y) %>%
    pull(z)
  return(RMSE(predicted_ratings, validation$rating))
})
rmse_regularization <- min(rmses)
rmse_regularization
```
Here we see that the RMSE of regularized movie user effect is 0.8653141 which is even more reduced than the movie-user effect model as seen previously.
```{r}
#Adding the Regularization result to the table
rmse_table <- bind_rows(rmse_table, tibble(Analysis = "Regularized Movie and User Effect", RMSE = rmse_regularization))
rmse_table %>% knitr::kable()

```
This table shows all the RMSES from the models, and the best model for prediction is Regularized Movie User Effect Model.
